## Description

This is a single-page application of my portfolio written in React. It uses conditional rendering to display 4 pages, including an About Me page, a Portfolio of projects I've worked on, a Contact page, and a Resume page. The footer contains links to my profiles and email. The Contact form does not currently have functionality.
